          <p class="fs-6">glacier in Antarctica, has yielded the first detailed maps of the underside of an ice shelf, revealing clues to future sea level rise.
            The findings are reported in the journal Science Advances.
            ‚ÄúWe have previously used satellite data and ice cores to observe how ice shelves change over time,‚Äù explains Anna W√•hlin, a professor of oceanography at the University of Gothenburg and the paper‚Äôs lead author. ‚ÄúBy navigating the submersible into the cavity, we were able to get high resolution maps of the ice underside. It‚Äôs a bit like seeing the back of the moon for the first time.‚Äù
            ‚ÄúOur ability to project the future of the global coastline from rising sea levels in a warming world critically depends on data we obtain from beneath Antarctic ice shelves,‚Äù adds David Holland, a professor at New York University‚Äôs Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and one of the paper‚Äôs authors.
            The scientists programmed Ran, an autonomous underwater vehicle, to dive into the cavity of Dotson Ice Shelf, 350 meters thick and located in West Antarctica, and scan the ice above it with an advanced sonar system. Dotson Ice Shelf is considered to have a potentially large impact on future sea level rise due to its size and location.</p>

          <p class="fs-6">Over 27 days, the submarine traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) back and forth under the glacier, reaching 17 kilometers (10.5 miles) into the cavity in order to capture the phenomena surrounding it.
            Using the data captured by Ran, the scientists were able to measure the currents below the glacier for the first time and prove why the western part of Dotson Ice Shelf melts so fast. Ran‚Äôs maps showed, not surprisingly, that the glacier melts faster where strong underwater currents erode its base and, in particular, very high melt at vertical fractures that extend through the glacier.
            But the findings also showed new patterns on the glacier base that raise troubling questions. The base is not smooth, but there is a peak and valley ice-scape with plateaus and formations resembling sand dunes. The researchers suggest that these may have been formed by flowing water under the influence of Earth‚Äôs rotation.
            ‚ÄúEarth‚Äôs rotation is critical to understanding most phenomena in the climate system, notably hurricanes and other severe-weather phenomena,‚Äù says Holland. ‚ÄúIt seems these exotic under-ice features are also intimately controlled and shaped by the spinning of the Earth.‚Äù</p>

            <p class="fs-6">‚ÄúThe maps that Ran produced represent a huge progress in our understanding of Antarctica's ice shelves,‚Äù adds Karen Alley, a glaciologist from the University of Manitoba and co-author of the paper. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had hints of how complex ice-shelf bases are, but Ran uncovered a more extensive and complete picture than ever before. The imagery from the base of Dotson Ice shelf helps us interpret and calibrate what we see from the satellites.‚Äù</p>

            <p class="fs-6">"Our ability to project the future of the global coastline from rising sea levels in a warming world critically depends on data we obtain from beneath Antarctic ice shelves." David Holland, a professor of mathematics and ocean-atmosphere science at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.‚Äù
              Much of the fieldwork for the Science Advances study was conducted in 2022, when Holland led a team to install a mooring beneath the ice shelf. This innovative engineering effort involved drilling a 1,000-foot-deep, one-foot-wide hole through the ice shelf using a hot water drill. The mooring was successfully installed before the ice froze again, allowing scientists to collect data continuously for the past two years‚Äîand to produce a time series of the changes in the melting at the bottom of the ice shelf.
              ‚ÄúFor the first time, we combined data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle, sampling at one point in time but covering a large area under an ice shelf, with data from a mooring that we installed with a hot</p>

            <p class="fs-6">water drill through the ice shelf,‚Äù notes Holland. ‚ÄúThese dual methods provided data at one point in space but spanned over time continuously,‚Äù
              The scientists now realize there is a wealth of processes left to discover in future research missions under the glaciers.
              ‚ÄúThe mapping has given us new data that we need to look at more closely,‚Äù concludes W√•hlin. ‚ÄúIt is clear that many previous assumptions about melting of glacier undersides are falling short. Current models cannot explain the complex patterns we see. But with this method, we have a better chance of finding the answers.‚Äù
              The research was supported, in part, by grants from the National Science Foundation (164700, 511300, 511600, 529200, 919900).</p>

          Meanwhile, at the other end of the planet, the maximum winter ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean is consistent with an ongoing 46-year decline.
          Satellite images reveal that the total area of the Arctic Ocean covered in sea ice reached 5.8 million square miles (15.01 million square kilometres) on March 14. That‚Äôs 247,000 square miles (640,000 square kilometers) less ice than the average between 1981 and 2010. Overall, the maximum winter ice coverage in the Arctic has shrunk by an area equivalent to the size of Alaska since 1979.
          This year‚Äôs Arctic ice maximum is the 14th lowest on record. Complex weather patterns make it difficult to predict what will happen in any given year.

              Shrinking ice makes Earth more susceptible to solar heating. ‚ÄúThe sea ice and the snow on top of it are very reflective,‚Äù Boisvert said. ‚ÄúIn the summer, if we have more sea ice, it reflects the Sun‚Äôs radiation and helps keep the planet cooler.‚Äù
              On the other hand, the exposed ocean is darker and readily absorbs solar radiation, capturing and retaining that energy and ultimately contributing to warming in the planet‚Äôs oceans and atmosphere.
              Sea ice around the poles is more susceptible to the weather than it was a dozen years ago. Ice thickness measurements collected with laser altimeters aboard NASA‚Äôs ICESat-2 satellite show that less ice has managed to stick around through the warmer months. This means new ice must form from scratch each year, rather than building on old ice to make thicker layers. Thinner ice, in turn, is more prone to melting than multi-year accumulations.
              ‚ÄúThe thought is that in a couple of decades, we‚Äôre going to have these essentially ice-free summers,‚Äù Boisver
